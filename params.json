Each league table contains a certain number of football teams, each football team has the information of ranking, number of played match and point.\r\nAfter scraping data, I store these data into a small database. My database implemented as a TCP server. We also defined our own application protocol for the communication between the client and the server. For the detail, please read [this file](./document/Report.pdf)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
